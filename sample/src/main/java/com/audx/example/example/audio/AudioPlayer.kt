/**
 * Wrapper for Android's AudioTrack that plays back PCM audio with dynamic sample rate support.
 *
 * This class provides:
 * - Dynamic sample rate configuration (16kHz for this example app)
 * - Thread-safe playback control with ReentrantLock
 * - Chunk-based streaming with 100ms buffers
 * - Graceful stop and cleanup handling
 * - Automatic playback completion detection
 *
 * Audio configuration:
 * - Channels: Mono (1 channel)
 * - Encoding: PCM 16-bit
 * - Usage: MEDIA
 * - Content type: MUSIC
 *
 * The player is designed to work with audio at the same sample rate it was recorded,
 * ensuring proper playback speed and pitch.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * val player = AudioPlayer()
 * player.initialize(16000).getOrThrow()
 * player.play(audioData) // Suspends until playback completes
 * player.release()
 * ```
